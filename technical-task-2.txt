Explaination:

EventBridge triggers the flow.

Enrichment Lambda conditionally enriches the event using external APIs.

Notification Dispatcher Lambda routes to WebSocket, Push, or Email.

WebSocket support via API Gateway and DynamoDB connection tracking.

Mobile push via SNS -> APNs / FCM.

Email via SES using templates and dynamic content.

Logging & Monitoring integrated via CloudWatch.
